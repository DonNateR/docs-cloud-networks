===============================================

What's new
----------

-  The Cloud Networks API |contract version| now includes operations for security groups
   and security group rules. These operations, described in detail in the Cloud Networks 
   API Developer Guide, allow you to create, read, update, and delete security groups and 
   to create, read, update, and delete security group rules. You can add rules to the 
   security groups, and, using the port API operations, assign the groups to servers to 
   manage the ingress (inbound) traffic for a port on a server.
