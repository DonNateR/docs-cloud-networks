===============================================

What's new
----------

-  The Cloud Networks API |contract version| now includes installation instructions for the
   neutron client and usage examples in the Getting Started Guide. The neutron client 
   provides a simple, command line interface to the Cloud Networks API, similar to the nova 
   client for Cloud Servers or the trove client for Cloud Databases. All these clients are 
   actually executing cURL operations in the background.
