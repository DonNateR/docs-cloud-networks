    <title>Install the nova client with the Cloud Networks extension (optional)</title>
    <!--<para>To manage your servers from the command line, you can use the open-source nova client application called
            <literal>python-novaclient</literal>. </para>
    <para>To install the nova client, you first install the <literal>rackspace-novaclient</literal> package, which includes
        the nova client and the Rackspace extensions including the Cloud Networks extension.</para>-->
    <para>The Rackspace Neutron API doesn’t currently offer a way to attach networks to, and detach networks from, a server.
        If you want to attach and detach networks by using the nova client, you must use the Cloud Networks virtual interface
        extension by installing the <literal>os_virtual_interfacesv2_python_novaclient_ext</literal> package.</para>
    <note>
        <para>The python-novaclient is developed and maintained by the OpenStack community. Although we do not directly
            support python-novaclient, you can post in the comments below if you run into any difficulties.</para>
