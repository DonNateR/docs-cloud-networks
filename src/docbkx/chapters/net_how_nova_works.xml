    <title>How the nova client works</title>
    <para>The nova client is an open-source Python client that lets you run commands to make API calls. This client
        is easy to learn and use. Each nova client command runs cURL commands that embed API requests. You can run the
        nova client from a desktop machine or remote system, such as a Cloud Server. </para>
    <para>You install the nova client on a Linux distribution or on Mac OS X. To install the nova client, see <olink
            targetdoc="cn-gettingstarted" targetptr="install_nova">“Step 1. (Optional) Install the nova Client with the Cloud
            Networks Extension”</olink>. </para>
    <para>To configure the nova client, you update your bash profile to set and export nova environment variables. </para>
    <note>
        <para>You can specify a debug parameter on any nova command to show the underlying API request for the command. This
            is a good way to become familiar with the API requests. </para>
    </note>
    <warning>
        <para>If you upgrade the operating system of the desktop or remote machine where you installed nova, you may need to
            reinstall nova.</para>
