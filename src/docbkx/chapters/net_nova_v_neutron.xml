    <title>Networking: Neutron versus Nova-Network</title>
    <para>Rackspace first introduced networking services that were based on the OpenStack Nova-Network API and exposed these
        services via the <literal>/os-networksv2</literal> Cloud Servers extension. For documentation on these operations,
        see
        <link xlink:href="http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v2/cs-devguide/content/network_extension.html">
                 Network extension</link>
        of the <citetitle>Next Generation Cloud Servers Developers Guide</citetitle>. This version of the service is now
        superseded by the current networking API, based on OpenStack Neutron, which offers a richer suite of networking
        services. Both APIs continue to function, but the Neutron API will be the base for all the future networking services
        that Rackspace offers. We recommend that you use the Neutron API for your Cloud Networks API operations.</para>
    <para>The current API introduces three new top-level resources &mdash;<literal>/networks</literal>,
            <literal>/ports</literal>, and <literal>/subnets</literal>&mdash; which are included in the OpenStack Neutron
        API. All new networking services that we offer will make use of these resources and build on the OpenStack Neutron
        API to help you build rich networking topologies and configure advanced network services.</para>
    <para>As part of the new API, the following new capabilities are available to users:<itemizedlist>
