    <title>Networking: nova-network versus neutron</title>
    <para>Rackspace first introduced networking services by using the nova-network API based on OpenStack. Now we are
        providing the neutron API, also based on OpenStack, which offers more functionality and flexibility than the
        nova-network API. Both sets of APIs continue to work well, but the neutron API will be the base for all the future
        networking services that Rackspace offers. </para>
    <para>We recommend that you use the neutron API for your Cloud Networks API operations.</para>
    <para>The neutron API provides three primary, top-level resources (networks, ports, and subnets) and includes the ability
        to perform the following functions: <itemizedlist>

    <note>
        <para>The neutron API operations return only JSON-formatted responses. There is no option to receive responses in
            XML.</para>
