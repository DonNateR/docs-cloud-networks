    <title>How the neutron client works</title>
    <note>
        <para>The neutron client is not supported at this time. When it is available, this document will be
            updated.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The neutron client is an open-source Python client that you use to run commands to make API calls. Currently, the
        neutron client is not available, but it will be supported soon. Each client command will run cURL commands
        that embed API requests. Once it is available, you will be able to run the client from a desktop computer or remote
        system, such as a cloud server. Until then, use cURL commands to make Neutron API calls.</para>

    <para>To configure the client, update your bash profile to set and export environment variables. </para>
    <note>
        <para>You can specify a debug parameter on any neutron command to show the underlying API request for
            the command. This is a good way to become familiar with the API requests. </para>
    </note>
    <warning>
        <para>If you upgrade the operating system of the desktop or remote machine where you installed them, you may need to
            reinstall the neutron client.</para>
