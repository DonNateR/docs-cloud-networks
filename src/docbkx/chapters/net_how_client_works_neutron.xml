    <title>How the neutron client works</title>
    <para>The neutron client is an open-source Python client that you use to run commands to make API calls. Each client
        command runs cURL commands that embed API requests. The client runs from a desktop computer or remote system, such as
        a cloud server.</para>
    <para>To install and configure the neutron client on a Linux distribution or on Mac OS X, see 
        <link xlink:href="install_neutron.html">Install the neutron client (optional)</link>.</para>
    <para>To export environment variables (see
        <link xlink:href="export_env_vars.html">Export environment variables to run cURL commands (optional)</link>.</para>
    <note>
        <para>You can specify <literal>--debug</literal> as the first parameter on any neutron command to show the underlying
            API request for the command. This is a good way to become familiar with API requests. For example: neutron
            --debug net-list.</para>
    </note>
    <warning>
        <para>If you upgrade the operating system of the desktop or remote machine where you installed the client, you may
            need to reinstall the neutron client.</para>
