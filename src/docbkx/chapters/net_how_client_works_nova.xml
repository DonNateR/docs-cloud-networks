    <title>How the nova client works</title>
    <para>The nova client is an open-source Python client that lets you run commands to make Nova-Network API calls. The
        client is easy to learn and use. Each client command runs cURL commands that embed API requests. You can run the
        client from a desktop computer or remote system, such as a cloud server. </para>
