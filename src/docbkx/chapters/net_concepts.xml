        <para>A network is an isolated virtual layer-2 broadcast domain that is typically reserved for the tenant who created
            it, unless the network is configured to be shared. Tenants can create up to 10 networks per region. </para>
        <para>In the Networks API v2.0, the network is the main entity. Ports and subnets are always associated with a
            network.</para>

        <para>A security group is a named container for security group rules, which provide Rackspace Public Cloud users the

            <para>There are no default security groups created for you in your Rackspace account. In order to use security

        <title>Sharing IP Addresses</title>
        <!--availwarn-->
        <important>
            <para>The Shared IP Address API is currently in Early Access. It is available for Managed Infrastructure
                customers and Managed Operations customers. It is not available for RackConnect customers. To use
                this feature, contact Rackspace Support.</para>
        </important>
        <para>A shared IP address is a special case where an additional IP address, shared between 2 or more Cloud Server
            virtual machines (VMs), facilitates fail-over in a redundant, highly available, configuration.</para>
        <para>For example, if you have a group of cloud servers deployed to offer certain l4-L7 services in a redundant setup
            (such as an Nginx, or HAProxy, load-balancer or a Vyatta firewall appliance/router), one of the servers acts as
            the primary server and the others act as backups. In this case, the active server owns the Shared IP address.
            External clients use the Shared IP address on the Public interface as the IP to communicate with the cluster. If
            the active, or primary, server goes down, the backup takes over. There is no impact on clients that are use the
            shared IP address, because the IP address the the clients use doesn't change despite the server going
            down.</para>
        <para>The application that implements redundancy controls both the failover mechanism and transfer of ownership of
            the shared IP address. This process happens entirely in the data-plane by using protocols such as VRRP,
            keepalived, linux-HA, or other applications that manage failover between hosts in a redundant setup.</para>
        <section xml:id="conceptSharedIPClusterEx">
            <title>Cluster examples with multiple shared IP addresses</title>
            <para>Within a cluster with various services, each service gets it's own IP address. This allows each service to
                migrate independently between members to share the load. There may be as many IP addresses as the customer
                has unique services, or roles, in the cluster. For example, you may have a 2-node cluster with one node
                running a MySQL database and the other running a network file system (NFS). The natural operation is to have
                each node run one service, and, during maintenances, run them both temporarily on the same node.</para>
            <para>In MySQL-MMM (the multi-master replication manager), it is fairly common to have a Reader role on one IP
                address and a Writer role on another IP address. In this case, each service's IP address stays with its
                service, but the IP address may relocate to the other node as needed. As in the previous case, run each role
                on a different node but sometimes run them together during maintenances.</para>
            <para>In general, a cluster has more than 2 servers and potentially many shared IP addresses. Each shared IP
                address needs to be able to reside on any server in the cluster. Take the extreme example of a cluster of 10
                servers, with 8 shared IP addresses. At one moment, the shared IP addresses may all be assigned to different
                servers. At another moment, all 8 may need to be assigned to just one of the servers. The cluster may decide
                to move 1 or more of the shared IP addresses to another server in the cluster at any time.</para>

    <!-- Layer 3 Router -->

        <title>Router</title>
        <para> A router is used to interconnect subnets and forward traffic among them. Another feature of the router is to
            NAT internal traffic to external networks. A router has an interface for each associated subnet. By default, the
            IP address of an interface is the subnet's gateway IP. Also, whenever a router is associated with a subnet, a
            port for that router interface will be added to the subnet's network. See
